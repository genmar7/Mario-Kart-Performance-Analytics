# Mario-Kart-Performance-Analytics
The goal of this project is to analyze driver combinations–drivers, vehicles, tires, and gliders–to uncover performance patterns and insights. 
Using web-scraped data from race results, it demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory analysis workflows in Python. 

## Key Features
- Scrapes and processes HTML race data into clean CSV tables.
- Applies outlier detection techniques to identify anomalous driver setups.
- Visualizes relationships between components and race outcomes.
- Fully reproducible with provided code, sample data, and documentation.
